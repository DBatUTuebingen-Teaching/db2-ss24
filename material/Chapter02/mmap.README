mmap.c

Map a MonetDB tail file (persistent representation of a column
vector) into memory and print its contents.  Assumption: the tail
file contains integers, i.e., the associated BAT is of type bat[:int].

Adapt the definition of macro TAIL to point to your actual tail file
(recall MAL command bat.info()).

Compile via

  cc -Wall -O2 mmap.c -o mmap

Execute via

  ./mmap
