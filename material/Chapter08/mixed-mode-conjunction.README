mixed-mode-conjunction.c

Implement the conjunctive predicate c < v AND c % 2 = 0 using
three methods:

- A: use branch-less selection for both clauses
- B: place c < v in if () branch; if c < v is predictable, save work
     and benefit significantly
- C: place c % 2 = 0 in if () branch; doomed to perform worst due
     to unpredictable outcome of the predicate over random c values


Compile via (no -O2 optimization here for dramatic effect):

  cc -Wall mixed-mode-conjunction.c -o mixed-mode-conjunction

Execute via

  ./mixed-mode-conjunction

  selectivity of the conjunctive predicate
  (never reaches 100% due to clause c % 2 = 0
   evaluated over the random values in vector c)
