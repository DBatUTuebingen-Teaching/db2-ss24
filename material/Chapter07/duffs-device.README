duffs-device.c

Demonstrates a trick devised by Tom Duff (back in 1983 when
Duff was working for Lucasfilm, for Duff's original posting
please see http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html).
Enables routines to offer loop unrolling (8-fold in the case
of this sample file) and still perform correctly for vector
size that are not divisible by 8.  Note the unorthodox folding
of the do/while() and switch() constructs of C.

(Mainly shown here for complete historical record and anecdotal
value.)

Compile via

  cc -Wall -O2 duffs-device.c -o duffs-device

Execute via

  ./duffs-device

Sample output:

  after send():      to[254] = 0     # ‚Üê 0 indicates that send() has copied too few vector entries
  after duff_send(): to[254] = 42
